VOA3R AgRes is an application profile of the Dublin Core metadata standard. Application Profiles (AP) are defined as schemas which consist of data elements drawn from one or more namespaces, combined together by implementers, and optimised for a particular local application. VOA3R AgRes is entirely compatible and interoperable with Dublin Core and does not displace any other metadata standard. VOA3R AgRes can coexist with other metadata specifications based on different semantics.

Check out the VOA3R wiki for more information:

Two levels of the VOA3R AgRes AP have been defined:

 *  VOA3R AgRes AP â€“ Level 2 constitutes a flat metadata set focused on the description of the VOA3R resource.
 *  VOA3R AgRes AP - Level 4 implements the modular metadata approach, offering DSP interoperability. 
    It conforms to the DCMI Description Set Profile specification.
