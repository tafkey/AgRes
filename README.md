# AgRes

AgRes is an **metadata application profile** of the Dublin Core metadata standard. 
Application Profiles (AP) consist of data elements drawn from one or more namespaces, 
combined together by implementers, and optimised for a particular local application. 

AgRes is entirely compatible and interoperable with Dublin Core and does not displace 
any other metadata standard. Moreover, AgRes can coexist with other metadata 
specifications based on different semantics.


Two levels of the VOA3R AgRes AP have been defined:

 *  **AgRes AP â€“ Level 2** constitutes a flat metadata set focused on the description of the resource.
 *  **AgRes AP - Level 4** implements the modular metadata approach, offering *DSP interoperability*. It conforms to the DCMI Description Set Profile specification.
